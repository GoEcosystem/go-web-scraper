## Go Web Scraper Architecture

This document outlines the architecture and design principles of the Go Web Scraper project, explaining how the different components interact to create a robust web scraping solution.

## High-Level Architecture

The Go Web Scraper follows a modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability. The system is divided into several components:

## Core Components

### 1. Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Located in `cmd/scraper/main.go`, the CLI provides a user-friendly interface for:
- Configuring scraping parameters
- Initiating scraping jobs
- Exporting data to various formats
- Starting the web server

The CLI uses the Go standard library `flag` package for argument parsing and configuration.

### 2. Scraper Modules

The `scrapers/` directory contains individual scraper implementations:

- **Base Scraper Interface** (`scrapers/scraper.go`): Defines the interface that all scrapers must implement
- **Hacker News Scraper** (`scrapers/hackernews.go`): Extracts articles from Hacker News
- **Bookstore Scraper** (`scrapers/bookstore.go`): Extracts products from a bookstore website

Each scraper implements the following interface:

```go
type Scraper interface {
    Initialize() error
    Scrape(options ScrapeOptions) ([]interface{}, error)
    Name() string
}
```

### 3. Data Models

The `models/` directory contains data structures for:

- **Article** (`models/article.go`): Represents articles from news sites
- **Product** (`models/product.go`): Represents products from e-commerce sites
- **Scraper** (`models/scraper.go`): Represents scraper configuration and metadata

These models are used across the application for data persistence and API responses.

### 4. Database Layer

Located in `db/` directory, the database layer handles:

- Database connection and initialization
- Schema creation and migrations
- CRUD operations for scraped data
- Query building and execution

The application uses SQLite for persistent storage, providing a lightweight yet powerful database solution.

### 5. Web Interface

The web interface is contained in the `web/` directory and consists of:

- **HTTP Server** (`web/server.go`): Handles HTTP requests and response rendering
- **Templates** (`web/templates/`): HTML templates using Go's `html/template` package
- **Static Assets** (`web/static/`): CSS, JavaScript, and images
- **API Endpoints** (`web/api.go`): RESTful API for accessing scraped data

The web interface uses the standard Go `net/http` package without external frameworks to minimize dependencies.

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Either through CLI flags or web interface forms
2. **Scraper Selection**: The appropriate scraper is selected based on the target website
3. **Data Extraction**: The scraper navigates the website and extracts structured data
4. **Processing**: Raw data is processed and transformed into the appropriate models
5. **Storage**: Data is stored in the SQLite database
6. **Presentation**: Data is either exported to files or presented via the web interface

## Concurrency Model

The application leverages Go's concurrency primitives:

- **Goroutines**: Used for parallel scraping and processing
- **Channels**: Used for communication between scraping workers
- **Sync Package**: Used for coordination and synchronization

The concurrency model is implemented in `utils/collector.go`, which provides:

- Rate limiting to respect website policies
- Work distribution across multiple goroutines
- Error handling and propagation

## Database Schema

The SQLite database schema includes the following tables:

### Articles Table

```
+-----------------+-------------+
| Column          | Type        |
+-----------------+-------------+
| id              | INTEGER     |
| title           | TEXT        |
| url             | TEXT        |
| author          | TEXT        |
| points          | INTEGER     |
| comments        | INTEGER     |
| date            | TIMESTAMP   |
| source          | TEXT        |
| content         | TEXT        |
+-----------------+-------------+
```

### Products Table

```
+-----------------+-------------+
| Column          | Type        |
+-----------------+-------------+
| id              | INTEGER     |
| title           | TEXT        |
| price           | REAL        |
| description     | TEXT        |
| image_url       | TEXT        |
| rating          | REAL        |
| category        | TEXT        |
| source          | TEXT        |
+-----------------+-------------+
```

### Categories Table

```
+----------------+       +----------------+
| id             |       | id             |
| name           |       | name           |
+----------------+       | parent_id      |
        ^                +----------------+
        |                        ^
        |                        |
+----------------+       +----------------+
| product_id     |       | category_id    |
| category_id    |       | product_id     |
+----------------+       +----------------+
```

## API Design

The REST API follows these principles:

- Resource-oriented routes (e.g., `/api/articles`, `/api/products`)
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- JSON responses with consistent structure
- Pagination for list endpoints
- Comprehensive error handling

## Authentication & Security

The application currently does not implement authentication as it's designed for personal use. However, it includes:

- Input validation to prevent SQL injection
- CORS headers for web security
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Ethical Scraping Measures

The application implements several measures to ensure ethical web scraping:

- Configurable delays between requests
- User-agent rotation to distribute load
- Respect for robots.txt directives
- Option to limit the depth and breadth of scraping

## Testing Strategy

The project includes various types of tests:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Testing complete user workflows

## Future Architecture Considerations

Planned architectural improvements include:

- Switching to a plugin architecture for scrapers
- Adding support for distributed scraping
- Implementing a more robust job queue
- Adding support for additional database backends
